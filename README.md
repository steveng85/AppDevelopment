# Hunt

We have made a native Android application using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, for the course '62416 - Advanced Mobile Application Development'. The app is called Hunt, and your objective is to go on an adventure, and hunt down the daily word, and take a picture of it. You'll compete against other people, by taking great pictures.

Happy hunting!
